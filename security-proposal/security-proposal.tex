\section{Introduction}
Authentication is a fundamental aspect of information security, it provides protection against impersonations and false messages. A strategy implemented in a comunication system to achieve such protection is called an \textit{authentication scheme}.

An authentication scheme is said to be secure if the if the chance that an impostor fools the system is so small that it does not represent a risk in the communication (comparable to channel noise).

A common scheme is to add a \textit{digital signature} at the end of each message. This signature is generated with asymetric cryptography: The message is compressed to a fixed size with a cryptographic hash function (like SHA-256), this hash is then encrypted with the emisor's private key. In order to verify the message, the receiver compares the message's hash with the decripted signature if they differ the message is forged.

Without the private key the best the enemy can do is try different keys until the message is accepted. This takes $2^{n-1}$ tries on average ($n$ is the size of the key). HTTPS specifies a maximum key size of 2048 bits and RSA encryption. A brute ofrce atack would take $2^{2047} \approx 10^{616}$ tries, impossible task for current computers.

But if an eficient solution to the factorization into prime factors is used to break the key (Shor's algorithm \cite{b1}) or if the impostor's computational power drastically increases, the digital signature is useless for authentication protection.

With this in mind \cite{b2} proposes a different kind of authentication schemes, called \textit{A-schemes}, that remains secure regardless of the impostor's computational power. Three parts interact in the comunication system, \A\ an information source that wishes to communicate an element of the set of all possible source states $\s$, \B\ a receiver and \E\ the impostor.

\A\ will transform the source states into \textit{cyphered messages} (sequences compatible with the communication channel) by means of an \textit{encoding rule}. An encoding rule $r\in\r$ is a one-to-one mapping from $\s$ to $\m$. \B\ accepts a message $m$ as authentic if $m\in r[\s]$ and retireves the original state with the pre-image $r^{-1}(m)$. This schema is represented in Figure~\ref{figModelo3Participantes}.

An A-schema is a 5-tuple $\aprottuple$, where $\ped{S}$ denotes a stochastic process over the set of all source states ie. the \textit{information source}, and $\pr$ is the probability distribution over the set of encoding rules. An \textit{A-code} is the 3-tuple $\acodetuple$ also refeered as the A-scheme's combinatorial structure.

The impostor's best strategy is to listen to the first $t$ cyphered messages and with a cryptanalytical analysis, forge a message with the highest probability of success. The \textit{unconditional probability of success of order $t$} ($P_t$) is the expected percentage of successfully spoofed messages.

$P_t$ is the mesurement of the security of an A-scheme, \cite{b3} demonstrates the theoretical lower bound for the unconditional probability of sucess, in terms of informatic entropy:
\[
    P_t \geq
    e^{
    \hc{R\;\;}{\;M^{t+1}}
    - \hc{R\;\;}{\;M^{t}}
    }
\]

Finally \cite{b4} characterizes the A-schemes that achieve the theoretical lower bound. Such schemes satisfy two conditions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The information source $\ped{S}$ is message uniform.
    \item The underlying A-code structure is a strong partially balanced $t$-design (SPBD).
\end{itemize}

\section{Proposal's objective}
The unconditional probability of success is the \textit{expected} percentage of successfully spoofed messages, however very little is known about the probability distribution and variance of this random process.

On the other hand, the caracterization of perfect A-schemes imposes a restriction over the information source ($\ped{S}$ must be message uniform), that most information sources don't meet. Several unknown questions rises:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How much $P_t$ differs from its theoretical lower bound, given an A-schemes with non message uniform source?
    \item Are SPBD the best A-code structure for such schemes?
\end{itemize}

Insight is needed to solve both problems. My proposal's objective is to implement in Wolfram language, a pseudorandom simulation tool of the impostor's strategy, that will allow to generate data to statistically describe the spoof percentage, distirbution and variance.

The simulations will be done over distinct information sources and distinct A-codes, focusing on the two questions related to non message uniform information sources.

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a
separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before
formatting.
proofreading, spelling and grammar.

\subsection{Information source}\label{AA}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as
IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use
abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Balanced t-designs}

\subsection{Strategy simulation}

Be sure that the
symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words
rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to
avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity
``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including
units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only
with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization
\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of
quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not.
